# Robust Learning of Fixed-Structure Bayesian Networks
A MATLAB implementation of [Robust Learning of Fixed-Structure Bayesian Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07384).

Explanation of Files
===

Our experiments (`filter` directory)
---
* `filter_bn_sparse.m`: Synthetic experiments (Section 4.1).  Evaluate the performance of different algorithms (MLE, RANSAC, Filtering) when the graph structure of the ground-truth Bayes net is a random tree or a random graph.
* `filter_bn_alarm.m`: Semi-synthetic experiments (Section 4.2).  Evaluate the performance of different algorithms when the ground-truth Bayes net is the ALARM network (see below for more details).
* `empirical_bn.m`: Compute the empirical conditional probabilities of a known-structure Bayes net.
* `dtv_bn.m`: Estimate the total variation distance between two Bayes nets that have the same structure (Appendix C.2).

The ALARM Bayes net (`alarm` directory)
---
* `alarm.bif`: The ALARM network from [The ALARM Monitoring System: A Case Study with Two Probabilistic Inference Techniques for Belief Networks](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-93437-7_28) in BIF format, downloaded from https://www.bnlearn.com/bnrepository.
* `parseBIF.cpp`: Parse `alarm.bif` and convert the multi-valued ALARM network into binary-valued.  The binary Bayes net is used in `filterBN_ALARM.m`.
